This is fine for small networks with a few tensors, but it would be extremely inconvenient and error-prone to track tens or hundreds of tensors in larger networks.\n","\n","PyTorch provides the `nn.Module` API for you to define arbitrary network architectures, while tracking every learnable parameters for you. In Part II, we implemented SGD ourselves. PyTorch also provides the `torch.optim` package that implements all the common optimizers, such as RMSProp, Adagrad, and Adam. It even supports approximate second-order methods like L-BFGS! You can refer to the [doc](http://pytorch.org/docs/master/optim.html) for the exact specifications of each optimizer.\n","\n","To use the Module API, follow the steps below:\n","\n","1. Subclass `nn.Module`. Give your network class an intuitive name like `TwoLayerFC`. \n","\n","2. In the constructor `__init__()`, define all the layers you need as class attributes. Layer objects like `nn.Linear` and `nn.Conv2d` are themselves `nn.Module` subclasses and contain learnable parameters, so that you don't have to instantiate the raw tensors yourself. `nn.Module` will track these internal parameters for you. Refer to the [doc](http://pytorch.org/docs/master/nn.html) to learn more about the dozens of builtin layers. **Warning**: don't forget to call the `super().__init__()` first!\n","\n","3. In the `forward()` method, define the *connectivity* of your network. You should use the attributes defined in `__init__` as function calls that take tensor as input and output the \"transformed\" tensor. Do *not* create any new layers with learnable parameters in `forward()`! All of them must be declared upfront in `__init__`. \n","\n","After you define your Module subclass, you can instantiate it as an object and call it just like the NN forward function in part II.\n","\n","### Module API: Two-Layer Network\n","Here is a concrete example of a 2-layer fully connected network:"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"6RIJ7Y1v8zeU","colab_type":"code","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":34},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1594565038953,"user_tz":-540,"elapsed":4745,"user":{"displayName":"Keon Lee","photoUrl":"","userId":"07233833116801718973"}},"outputId":"51b2442d-71c7-4445-ce1c-dae30e36b0e1"},"source":["class TwoLayerFC(nn.Module):\n","    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, num_classes):\n","        super().__init__()\n","        # assign layer objects to class attributes\n","        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(input_size, hidden_size)\n","        # nn.init package contains convenient initialization methods\n","        # http://pytorch.org/docs/master/nn.html#torch-nn-init \n","        nn.init.kaiming_normal_(self.fc1.weight)\n","        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(hidden_size, num_classes)\n","        nn.init.kaiming_normal_(self.fc2.weight)\n","    \n","    def forward(self, x):\n","        # forward always defines connectivity\n","        x = flatten(x)\n","        scores = self.fc2(F.relu(self.fc1(x)))\n","        return scores\n","\n","def test_TwoLayerFC():\n","    input_size = 50\n","    x = torch.zeros((64, input_size), dtype=dtype)  # minibatch size 64, feature dimension 50\n","    model = TwoLayerFC(input_size, 42, 10)\n","    scores = model(x)\n","    print(scores.size())  # you should see [64, 10]\n","test_TwoLayerFC()"],"execution_count":13,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["torch.Size([64, 10])\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"5EYXQe2Z8zeW","colab_type":"text"},"source":["### Module API: Three-Layer ConvNet\n","It's your turn to implement a 3-layer ConvNet followed by a fully connected layer.

It is not as flexible as `nn.Module`, because you cannot specify more complex topology than a feed-forward stack, but it's good enough for many use cases.\n","\n","### Sequential API: Two-Layer Network\n","Let's see how to rewrite our two-layer fully connected network example with `nn.Sequential`, and train it using the training loop defined above.\n","\n","Again, you don't need to tune any hyperparameters here, but you shoud achieve above 40% accuracy after one epoch of training."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"_mrZh00j8zej","colab_type":"code","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":554},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1594566366373,"user_tz":-540,"elapsed":12671,"user":{"displayName":"Keon Lee","photoUrl":"","userId":"07233833116801718973"}},"outputId":"cd88f93b-2711-448d-bdf5-aec328b998c8"},"source":["# We need to wrap `flatten` function in a module in order to stack it\n","# in nn.Sequential\n","class Flatten(nn.Module):\n","    def forward(self, x):\n","        return flatten(x)\n","\n","hidden_layer_size = 4000\n","learning_rate = 1e-2\n","\n","model = nn.Sequential(\n","    Flatten(),\n","    nn.Linear(3 * 32 * 32, hidden_layer_size),\n","    nn.ReLU(),\n","    nn.Linear(hidden_layer_size, 10),\n",")\n","\n","# you can use Nesterov momentum in optim.SGD\n","optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=learning_rate,\n","                     momentum=0.9, nesterov=True)\n","\n","train_part34(model, optimizer)"],"execution_count":22,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["Iteration 0, loss = 2.3202\n","Checking accuracy on validation set\n","Got 167 / 1000 correct (16.70)\n","\n","Iteration 100, loss = 1.5176\n","Checking accuracy on validation set\n","Got 404 / 1000 correct (40.40)\n","\n","Iteration 200, loss = 1.8540\n","Checking accuracy on validation set\n","Got 401 / 1000 correct (40.10)\n","\n","Iteration 300, loss = 1.7532\n","Checking accuracy on validation set\n","Got 399 / 1000 correct (39.90)\n","\n","Iteration 400, loss = 1.8452\n","Checking accuracy on validation set\n","Got 416 / 1000 correct (41.60)\n","\n","Iteration 500, loss = 1.6159\n","Checking accuracy on validation set\n","Got 449 / 1000 correct (44.90)\n","\n","Iteration 600, loss = 1.9514\n","Checking accuracy on validation set\n","Got 425 / 1000 correct (42.50)\n","\n","Iteration 700, loss = 1.6633\n","Checking accuracy on validation set\n","Got 438 / 1000 correct (43.80)\n","\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"unby3Je28zek","colab_type":"text"},"source":["### Sequential API: Three-Layer ConvNet\n","Here you should use `nn.Sequential` to define and train a three-layer ConvNet with the same architecture we used in Part III:\n","\n","1.

When doing this there are a couple important things to keep in mind:\n","\n","- If the parameters are working well, you should see improvement within a few hundred iterations\n","- Remember the coarse-to-fine approach for hyperparameter tuning: start by testing a large range of hyperparameters for just a few training iterations to find the combinations of parameters that are working at all.\n","- Once you have found some sets of parameters that seem to work, search more finely around these parameters. You may need to train for more epochs.\n","- You should use the validation set for hyperparameter search, and save your test set for evaluating your architecture on the best parameters as selected by the validation set.\n","\n","### Going above and beyond\n","If you are feeling adventurous there are many other features you can implement to try and improve your performance. You are **not required** to implement any of these, but don't miss the fun if you have time!\n","\n","- Alternative optimizers: you can try Adam, Adagrad, RMSprop, etc.\n","- Alternative activation functions such as leaky ReLU, parametric ReLU, ELU, or MaxOut.\n","- Model ensembles\n","- Data augmentation\n","- New Architectures\n","  - [ResNets](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385) where the input from the previous layer is added to the output.\n","  - [DenseNets](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.06993) where inputs into previous layers are concatenated together.\n","  - [This blog has an in-depth overview](https://chatbotslife.com/resnets-highwaynets-and-densenets-oh-my-9bb15918ee32)\n","\n","### Have fun and happy training!
